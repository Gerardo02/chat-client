# Cool Websockets Group Chat

This simple websockets implementation serves the purpose of me expanding my knowledge on different network protocols aside from http.

## Requirements

You'll need to run the server locally, for this you need go installed. The server runs on version 1.22.0 but is go so probably the version you already have installed works fine.
You can refer to the repo [here.](https://github.com/Gerardo02/chat-server)

## Run Server

```
git clone https://github.com/Gerardo02/chat-server.git
cd chat-server
go run main.go
```

## Usage

While having the server up and running just enter [here](https://gerardo02.github.io/chat-client) and you will be able to chat through multiple instances of the same page.
